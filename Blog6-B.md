	<h2>Apache vs Nginx</h2>
<div>
<p>
	&#x2003; &#x2003; The Apache web server was initially released in 1995 at the beginning of the public internet. It was the first major
	open source server. So, by it's cost, usability and inclusion with most Linux Distro's, it became the mostly widely used server 
	in the world. Nine years after Apache's release, Nginx was came on the scene. Initially, it was put in front of Apache servers. This
	was done in order to offload work from the host server to a front facing caching server. This sped up request response times greatly. This
	may have been a short cut of using the improvements that Nginx servers provided without migrating entire websites to Nginx servers. Funny
	enough that while Nginx servers showed themselves off they were being tied to a slower server behind it which also could be perceived
	as limiting the Nginx real abilities.

	&#x2003; &#x2003; Today, Apache and Nginx are used about the same amount throughout the world. Apache's architecture seems to showing its
	age with its limited response to large sets of simultaneous requests. Large web based companies like Netflix use Nginx servers. This can 
	help argue that Nginx is better. Certain benchmark testing has also come back showing Nginx is up to 2.5 times as fast as Apache servers.
	However, it may be that it depends on need. AWS uses both. Nginx is also considered more secure but Apache may be better for newer
	web developers. Apache is older and has a larger community with more history working within Apache. If you're a large company looking to 
	deliver content as fast as possible Nginx would be better suited but if you're a small company trying to host their own content then 
	Apache may be what you want. Both are useful. However, if no other metric is used it can be assumed by the picture above that Nginx may well
	take over Apache's 26 year old majority.
