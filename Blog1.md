	<p>
	I wanted to know what the most common type of attack on a network.
	It turns out that one of the most agreed upon types of attacks in a
	SQL injection (SQLi). It mainly conforms to the idea that there is a
	php call to a SQL language based server. Since SQL is a query language,
	a query can be manipulated to control a database (or more). It can be
	done several ways. The page I read from based their example on a password
	manipulation where the user name and password query is appended with
	"OR 1=1". In the example given this creates a situation that makes the
	"WHERE" clause return the first username and password indexed. It went
	further to state that since administrator accounts are towards the top
	in terms indexing it is likely this account found will be that of an 
	administrator. Thus, not only gaining control of the entire  database,
	but even possibly the server itself. Once this is done it doesn't take a great
	deal of imagination to realize the server is completely compromized.

	The article gave a few basic recommendations to secure a server and webpage.
	As with all things IT, training and awareness are paramount. One should 
	always assume any user, including authorized users are attempting to 
	be malicious. Filter using whitelists, not blacklists, as blacklists are
	more vulnerable because there is a set number of entities to a blacklists while there are only
	a few whitelists and thus blacklists all things not whitelisted. Of course
	they go on to advertise their product to help with combating SQLi instead
	of creating SQLi countermeasures from scratch. However, it can be done
	as many sites exist to aid in counter acting SQLi attempts
