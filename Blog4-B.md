	&#x2003; &#x2003; John the Ripper is a brute force password cracker. Its CLI command is simply "john". It is an opens source/free command line software. There is also a pro version that does cost money but isn't necessary.
  It isn't completely user friendly because the user must have some aptitude for understanding how interact with a command line and how password and salt hashing works.
  It can automatically determine the hash passwword type (e.g. MD5,Sha-256) but it isn't full-proof. It was originally 
  created in 1996 for UNIX systems. Today it can be used on UNIX, LINUX, Windows, and others. John The Ripper was originally created to test password strength against
  a known dictionary. It can use a dictionary attack. Dictionary attacks are a file of known passwords and then attempts to reproduce the password hash of the victim using 
  the dictionary. It can alter the dictionary words to try slight variations which can give it a better chance of finding a password  than brute forcing it blindly.
  It has a brute force mode that manually runs through all possible plaintexts. Clearly this is not very effective as it can run for a very long time 
  with possibly no answer. However, that is the biggest drawback to brute force attacks. It can also use rainbow tables but these still have the drawback of salts length
  can be very long. It does have a very cool feature to deal with this. If you have been running the incremental check to slowly check all possible platintexts and you
  decide to stop it mid-go you can always restart it with "john --restore". Twenty Five years after its original release it is still one of the most popular password crackers.
