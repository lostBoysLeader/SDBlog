	&#x2003; &#x2003; The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, is a rapidly growing sector of internet enabled devices that
	have little to no direct human control. This includes things like the Amazon Echo, Google Nest, Ring Doorbell, or almost anything that's described as "smart."
	Most devices gather sensor data and try to make informed decisions based on sensor data, like Ring Doorbell noticing someone is at the door so
	turns on the camera and sends an alert to your phone. Many IoT devices are designed to automate. Smart bulbs can turn themselves on at dusk, a smart thermostat tries to learn
	when you want the temperature in the house to change, or echo can notify you when an Amazon package arrives. Some IoT devices are designed to 
	better understand healthcare needs. Its being used in agriculture and manufacturing
	to measure output based on predicted downtime or expected drought. It gives any kind of production the ability to monitor minute details that would
	otherwise go unnoticed to the human eye or due to the lack of manpower to watch every little thing that happens that slows the process down bit by bit.
	While these ideas are great, they come at an every increasing cost.

<br>
	
	&#x2003; &#x2003; Most devices right now run on IPv4. With more and more homes purchasing multiple IoT devices the number of needed IP 
	addresses will increase as well. This will help drive the eventual switchover to IPv6 mandatory for all devices in the future. Some IoT	
	devices work exclusively on a closed network so will only clog local traffic. However, even if only every person owns only one IoT device
	then that means there are seven billion IoT devices connecting to the internet at the same time people are trying to use their phones or
	laptops/desktops. So it will create a demand to bolster an ever stretched internet infrstructure. It is also much more vulnerable to hacking
	than traditional computers that have safeguards like antivirus software. They can be hijacked to due a hackers bidding and depending on the type
	of device inflict real harm on individuals. A Jeep was able to be hacked and then controlled to cause an accident, St. Jude's hackable cardiac
	devices could stop a persons heart or the Dyn Attack that used DDOS techniques to deny many users access to DNS servers, leaving their internet 
	capable devices practically useless. Most IoT devices aren't even designed with a firewall capabilities. This is partly due to the fact that
	they are sold as affordable products. While at present many companies don't attempt secure these devices hopefully it is mandated in the future. I
	believe the extra price to secure devices is worth the increase in cost or maybe we are better off with the technology anyways. IoT devices make our
	lives easier by automating it but can leave us complacent when danger is right in front of us.
