		<h2>Elliptic Curve Cryptopgraphy</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		&#x2003; &#x2003; Elliptic Curve Cryptopgraphy (ECC) is a newer version
		of the Diffie-Helman (DH) key exchange system that we now commonly call
		PKI or Public Key Infrastructure. DH is wide spread in use today
		to keep secure communications between networked devices. It is designed
		as an asymmetric encryption platform. Asymmetry is needed to pass
		keys to one another without giving anyone listening the ability to
		use the encryption/decryption algorithms. DH is very secure. Brute force
		attacks are futile because of the shear number of possible outcomes.
		However, when using such large numbers to encrypt and decrypt it takes
		a lot of processing power just for the two computers communicating.

		&#x2003; &#x2003; ECC keeps the security and asymmetry of Diffie-Helman
		but reduces the calculations need down significantly. This is important
		for instance like mobile application where processing power is much
		more taxing and less available. It achieves this by substituting large prime numbers 
		for the unique properties of elliptic curves, which are based with
		algebra. However, there area few worries about Elliptic Curve Cryptopgraphy. 
		Firstly, its vulnerable to side-channel attacks where implementation is 
		analyzed by the attacker to understand how the encryption works. It
		has also been shown to be vulnerable to quantum computing. In fact, much
		more vulnerable than Diffie-Hellman. This is only theoretical and a
		a quantum computer that could break elliptic curve encryption has yet to be built.
		So, for now Elliptic Curve Cryptopgraphy seems to have a place in network security,
		especially for mobile platforms!
