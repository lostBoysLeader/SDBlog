		<h2>NMAP</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		&#x2003; &#x2003; Nmap, or network mapper, is common tool for almost
		anyone working with a network, wether they are maintaining, penetration
		testing, or even hacking a network. It's free and open source which
		makes it widely available and verifiable. It's also available across
		Mac, Linux, and Windows so its even more versatile. GUI versions
		are even available for those who are even uncomfortable using the
		command line. It has several powerful commands to find out what ports
		are open and local addressing for every connection on the 
	<br>
	<br>
		&#x2003; &#x2003; Nmap is easy to install on linux with the command:<br>
		<div class=a>`sudo [package manager] install -nmap -y`</div>
		<br>
		You'll most likely need to install a command to find your IP Adress,
		but that varies by distro. You'll also need your subnet mask and 
		default gateway. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class=a>
		<img src="addr&mask.png" alt="local IP" width="734" height="52"> 
		</div>
		<br>
		A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is rather common. Using that, we know that
		or mask length is/24. <br>
		
		Now we need our gateway. `route -n` works for most linux distros. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class=a>
		<img src="route.png" alt="gateway" width="731" height="105"> 
		</div>
		<br> <br>
		Now we know our gateway is 192.168.1.1.
		<br> <br>
		Now run the command `nmap -s -P [gateway/mask length]`
		<br><br>
		<div class=a>
		<img src="nmap.png" alt="gateway" width="735" height="87"> 
		</div>
		<br> <br>
		This will return the IP address of every device connected to the network
		You can run further commands to find out what ports are open.
		I found a common one for my network was 7100. That port is commonly
		used for streaming devices like smart tv's, Apple TV, Amazon Firestick, etc.
		Having this information can be used to stem or start attacks on a network. Thus
		it really is powerful and depends on the user for execution.
