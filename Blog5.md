		<h2>AJAX && JSON</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		Since now, in 496P, my group's goal is to implement AJAX and JSON in
		order to display data on the webpage as users make requests, I need to
		finally learn about them. To my disbelief AJAX is not a language but
		simply a way to implement Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX); or
		in my case, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) substituted for XML. 
		It turns out that XML has fallen out of favor and isn't used as widely 
		as it was when it was created in the 1970's.

		There isn't much to learn about AJAX. For the most part COMP 484
		gave me enough info and to be able to make AJAX calls. It makes a call
		to the server and assigns the returned data to a tag. Instead of 
		the server having to resend the entire HTML page with the updated
		information. AJAX also cleanly
		uses jQuery to make its calls as well to the host server. For those 
		that are familiar with computer programming, JSON isn't difficult to 
		understand either. JSON is simply a standarization. This is needed
		so web server hosts can call data from its database and always expect
		the data to be returned in the same format so that a single call can
		be made and always expect the data to be returned in the exact same
		format without further code to do catch case scenarios. JSON sends data
		as and array of arrays. Where the overall array has sub-arrays of  data
		pairs. According to w3schools.com JSON can pull only parts of a document and parse
		only the parts you need of the document, while XML requires the whole 
		document be pulled and then parsed. Overall, from what I've read
		from w3schools and other places online this will simply be a "getting
		used to how to do it" rather than "spending hours trying to figure
		out how this works and is implemented"!
