	<p>
	I should preface this weeks blog by explaining that I am working along
	with classmates to to create a QR code reader / generator. Over the past
	week I have looked at several examples of how to implement these ideas
	into a webpage/app. All of them require jQuery. I have never implemented
	it but now apparently I need to understand it. jQuery simplifies using
	JavaScript on webpages. It hosts libraries much like formal programming languages
	such as Java. Just like Java uses the math library to generate a random number,
	jQuery can be used in just the same way. This speeds up programming by being able to
	reference a single document for any number of needed commands rather than having
	to rewrite code everytime every timea  page is created that needs it. It also helps
	standardize code writing making it easier to read others code, much like standardizing
	any real language.

	JQuery can be used in a few different ways. It can be created using the same
	concept as linking CSS. One can also use jQuery's official webpage file, called a CDN, and link it
	to their website. W3Schools gave another interesting idea. Google's jQuery
	can be linked. This is beneficial for a main reason. Whenever a jQuery file used,
	it must be downloaded by the client to be referenced. If a CDN, Content Delivery Network) is being used
	this could take a particularly long time since the files tend to be larger.
	Using Google's CDN would be beneficial since most people would already
	have it downloaded since most people use google.com. If the CDN is already
	cached by the client then there is no delay in downloading and can be
	referenced immediately. Conveniently for me, Google's CDN has JavaScript
	that will help create and read QR codes already. My next step is to implement
	this, but thats next weeks problem!
