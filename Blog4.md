		<h2>Stopping Bots</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		Bots have been a problem for many websites that have limited inventory
		of sought after products like limited clothing/shoe lines. Recently it
		has crept into Consumer Graphics Cards with when Nvidia released the
		RTX 3000 series graphics cards. No human can react fast enough to an
		interactive website fast enough to compete with an automated application a.k.a. 'bot'.
		However, bots aren't all bad. Bots are used in ecommerce on almost
		every major website. They use them mainly as a virtual assistants to the consumer.
		This is mainly done for the obvious reason of saving time and manpower, while
		attending to the customer. However, scalpers are assumed to be the biggest
		abusers of "malicious" bots. Scalpers will typically purchase a bot
		that has GUI. This makes it more user friendly to non-technical scalpers.
		Even with the simplicity of it, bot creators try to sell them in limited
		quantities to reduce the "fingerprint" or information that identifies the software.
		An IPS is needed to block these applications from completing transactions and
		genuine consumers that are only interested in the product and not others
		who wish to artificically and illegally inflate a products price.

		Captcha is a common way to thwart unwanted users on a website. Unfortunately,
		it has becomea victim of it's own success. Well designed bots can either get
		around these or pause to have the user solve the captcha itself. An integral
		part of speeding this process up is having an established IP address so that the
		user gets a simpler challenge to solve. Blocking known proxy services is also useful.
		It isn't perfect but will catch the bulk of these bots since they tend
		to use mainstream intermediaries. Like any unwanted network traffic
		thwarting bots is an ever evolving problem. Perpetrators will always
		find new ways to bypass security systems and IT specialists will
		be there creating new defense structures to defend against these
		attacks.
