	&#x2003; &#x2003; Air gapping is a network design that keeps all network traffic internal and cannot connect to the internet. It's main purpose is to protect the
  network against hacking of any kind for any purpose. While this does create some security, like any network security it has inherent flaws. Air gapping creates a sense of safety that isn't truly
  present. Famously, the Stuxnet worm was able to infiltrate an air gapped network in Iran by hijacking hardware and software intended to upgrade the air gapped system.
  A few years after Stuxnet was discovered computer scientists were able to use ultrasonic frequencies to hop software across micrphones and speakers of differente computers
  until the software was written into a system that could access the internet. Air gaps can be effective but must be deployed in conjunction with other network securities to
  help harden a system. Firewalls and associated software should always be used in any network or computer system to verify system behavior. It is especially worrisome since
  most systems that implement air gaps into networks are networks that help maintain all kinds of infrastructure needed for a modern society. So security must be taken as seriously
  as possible in these type of networks.
