	<h2>Big Data</h2>
<div>
<p>
	&#x2003; &#x2003; Big Data has become more prevelant as more data is generated, especially
	during the digital age. Before the digital age storing data was generally expensive and costs
	were high so data was created and then erased when it was no longer relevant. Now data storage
	is so cheap that its much more reasonable to keep every increasing large amounts of data. The creation
	of modern stoarge hardware like Solid State Drives has made it faster to read and write data.
	Since cost has gone down and speeds have gone it has opened the world to the idea of Big Data.
	Traditionally data was kept in "Silos" or simply segregated by use. So a marketing team may keep a
	set of data that applied to marketing and an R&D team may keep a set of data relevant to their work.
	These two data sets may seem to be vastly different but there may be some way to withdraw data from one
	that will be useful to the other. That's the problem Big Data is trying to solve.

	The general collection of data into a central storage rather than individual "Silos" is how Big Data
	starts. Big Data then uses algorithms to attempt to find correlations in data whether it is relational
	or not. It is continually being used in predicitive analytics in IT, healthcare, and even homelessness.
	Big Data does have one glaring vulnerability. It can draw correlations where there are none or entirely
	miss data much like people do. Google attempted to used big data to try to track the seasonal flu. It failed
	to follow the trend by 140%. Big Data may hold a certain future solving problems before humans can even
	perceive them. It also brings up ethical arguments about individual privacy and how easily Big Data can
	be manipulated to persecute people. No matter what Big Data has shown its great potential and will likely
	continue to be an influencing force on many facets of peoples' lives in the future.
