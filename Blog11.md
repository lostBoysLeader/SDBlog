		<h2>IT Ethics</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
		&#x2003; &#x2003; IT Professionals have access to a wealth of information. 
		Not only that of corporate / government data but idividuals working
		within those organizations. This brings up a few critical questions
		about where security measures impede privacy and even start to become
		unethical. Some work places, especially secure government sites, 
		require security measures that don't allow for much privacy for individuals.
		However, most work places that have IT infrastructure still have security
		measurses that do monitor traffic and may even monitor individual user traffic.
		A company does have the right to protect itself, even from its employees.
		But when is a company going too far? When they watch the screens of employees?
		If you need to do this, can you say you even trust your employees?
		If you trust your employees so little this is happening should you even employ them?
		Where is the line? What about IT consultants that may handle multiple companies data?
		What if they learn insider information about clients companies?

		&#x2003; &#x2003; In a recent Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, major Silicon
		Valley companies are being accused of acting with almost reckless
		abandon when it comes to peoples' personal information, in search of the almighty dollar.
		Edward Snowden seemed to be perplexed by how the U.S. Government 
		manipulates and accesses private information. Napster and other software
		like it are effectively stealing. Movies and books have been written about
		all of the biggest names in computers. Other tech giants have been accused
		of monopolies. Even in 2020 the internet is like the wild west. Even as an
		IT student my understanding of the internet is leaps and bounds above
		anyone I know that isn't part of the program or working in the industry.
		That's fine for most industries but IT permeates almost every facet of 
		ever modern person's life. It's also been stated repeatedly that 
		tech moves faster than our legislative systems. This creates a de
		facto self monitoring in the realm of the internet. While I have not
		attempted to answer these questions, they are certainly ones that
		anyone looking into IT for future employment should seriously consider.
		Finally, would taking a stand make a difference or simply alienate yourself?
		Could you sleep at night claming the Nuremburg Defense?
